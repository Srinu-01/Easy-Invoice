üîÅ MISSING FEATURES TO FIX & ADD

1. üßæ Client Section Updates (Header)

Add this new field: Client GST Number

Show it clearly in both:

Invoice creation form

Final invoice display and PDF




---

2. üíµ GST Calculation Section (Pricing Total)

After items are listed and totaled, add:

SGST (%) field

CGST (%) field

Final Total = subtotal + SGST + CGST


Display these on both:

Web invoice

Downloaded PDF


Editable by user; default values can be 9% each



---

3. üõí Item Description Field

Each item must include:

Item name (short)

Item description (long, multiline)


Description should show clearly and prominently on the final invoice



---

4. üè¶ Bank Details Section (Bottom of Invoice)

Add a new section for:

Bank Name

Account Number

IFSC Code

Branch Name

UPI ID
Show this in:

Invoice creation form

Final invoice

PDF output



---

5. üì≤ QR Code Generator with Total Amount

When user enters UPI ID, instantly generate a UPI QR Code

The QR code should automatically include:

UPI ID

Invoice total amount


Show QR code on:

Final invoice view

Exported PDF


Use a service like Google Chart API or a library to generate the QR code dynamically



---

6. üìÅ Recent Invoices Section ‚Äì Fix Buttons

Currently broken. Fix the following buttons to work fully:

Button	Must Do

Visit	Open the full invoice with all saved data from Firebase
Edit	Load invoice into form with pre-filled data
Download	Generate and download complete PDF
Print	Trigger browser print of the full invoice


These must pull actual invoice data from Firebase, not temporary or dummy values.


---

üß† BEHAVIORAL LOGIC

Every invoice must be saved in Firebase.

When user creates or edits an invoice:

All form fields are stored in Firebase

Cloudinary is used for image uploads (e.g., logo)

URL from Cloudinary is saved in Firebase


All recent invoices are shown using Firebase data

Ensure PDF includes:

Logo

Invoice title & number

Date

Client GST

SGST/CGST breakdown

Bank details

UPI QR code

Description for each item

Total amount
