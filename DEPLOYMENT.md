# Easy Invoice - Deployment Guide

## Current Issue Solution

The issue you're experiencing where the bundled server code is being served instead of the React application has been fixed with the following changes:

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `package.json`** - Separated build commands:
   - `npm run build` - Builds only the client (React app)
   - `npm run build:server` - Builds only the server
   - `npm run build:full` - Builds both client and server

2. **Created `vercel.json`** - Proper Vercel configuration:
   - Builds the client as a static site
   - Routes all requests to `index.html` (SPA routing)
   - Serves static assets correctly

3. **Updated `vite.config.ts`**:
   - Improved build configuration
   - Removed development-only plugins from production builds
   - Added proper rollup input configuration

4. **Cleaned up `client/index.html`**:
   - Removed Replit-specific development script

## Deployment Steps:

### For Vercel:

1. **Connect your repository** to Vercel
2. **Set build settings**:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/public`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

3. **Deploy** - Vercel will now serve your React application correctly

### Local Testing:

To test the build locally:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Serve the built files (you can use any static server)
npx serve dist/public
```

### Environment Variables:

If you need environment variables for Firebase or other services, add them in your Vercel dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables.

The application is now configured as a static React SPA and should deploy correctly to Vercel without showing the bundled server code.
